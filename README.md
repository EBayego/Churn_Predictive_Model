# Churn_Predictive_Model

## Project purpose
The objective of this project is to generate and test several prediction models to obtain the best model to predict whether a customer will churn in the near future.

## Breaf description
The models used include both supervised and unsupervised models, such as kmeans, OPTICS, DBSCAN, C50...

It also includes an explanation of the models used, as well as the results obtained and the conclusions of each one. The data are also analyzed in a way that makes them perfectly understandable.

In the files we find an R file, and an HTML file that includes the processed R document, in order to directly visualize the results of the operations. It also includes, of course, the dataset used.
